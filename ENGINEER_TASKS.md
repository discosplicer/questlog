# Questlog - Senior Software Engineer Sprint Tasks

## Project Overview
Questlog is a gamified task management application that transforms tasks into quests with AI-powered prioritization, experience points, and motivational design. The goal is to help users overcome executive function challenges through engaging, game-like experiences.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (Web), Electron (Desktop)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Fastify, Python + FastAPI (AI Service)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (cache/sessions)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Custom ML models
- **Infrastructure**: Cloudflare CDN/Gateway, AWS S3, Pinecone (vector DB)

### Task 5: Build Basic Quest Management API
**Priority**: High
**Story Points**: 8
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 days

**As a** developer, **I want** quest CRUD operations **so that** users can create, read, update, and delete quests.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Implement quest creation endpoint
- [ ] Implement quest listing with filtering
- [ ] Implement quest update endpoint
- [ ] Implement quest deletion endpoint
- [ ] Add quest status management (active, completed, etc.)

**Deliverables**:
- Complete quest CRUD API
- Quest status management
- Basic filtering and search
- Proper error handling and validation

**Definition of Done**:
- All quest operations work correctly
- API returns proper HTTP status codes
- Input validation prevents invalid data

## Notes for the Engineer

1. **Focus on MVP**: These tasks establish the foundation for the core quest management feature
2. **Security First**: Implement proper authentication and data validation from the start
3. **Documentation**: Keep setup guides and API docs updated as you build
4. **Testing**: Write basic tests for critical functionality
5. **Performance**: Consider database indexing and API optimization early

**Next Sprint Preview**: Once these foundation tasks are complete, the next sprint will focus on building the React frontend for quest management and implementing the gamification system.

Remember: You're building the foundation for a tool that will help people overcome executive function challenges. Focus on creating a solid, secure, and scalable base that can support the gamification and AI features to come.

Good luck! ðŸš€
