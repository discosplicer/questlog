# Questlog - Senior Software Engineer Sprint Tasks

## Project Overview
Questlog is a gamified task management application that transforms tasks into quests with AI-powered prioritization, experience points, and motivational design. The goal is to help users overcome executive function challenges through engaging, game-like experiences.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (Web), Electron (Desktop)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Fastify, Python + FastAPI (AI Service)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (cache/sessions)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Custom ML models
- **Infrastructure**: Cloudflare CDN/Gateway, AWS S3, Pinecone (vector DB)

## Current Sprint: Core Infrastructure (Next 2 Weeks)

### Task 5: Implement Quest CRUD API Endpoints
**Priority**: Critical
**Story Points**: 2
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

**As a** developer, **I want** to implement and test quest CRUD endpoints **so that** users can manage their quests via the API.

## Notes for the Engineer

1. **Agile Focus**: Each task is designed to be completed in one pull request
2. **User-Centric**: Focus on delivering value to users quickly
3. **Security First**: Implement proper authentication and data validation
4. **Documentation**: Update docs/ folder as you build
5. **Testing**: Write basic tests for critical functionality

**Next Sprint Preview**: Once these core tasks are complete, the next sprint will focus on AI-powered prioritization, gamification features (XP, levels), and advanced quest management.

Remember: You're building the foundation for a tool that will help people overcome executive function challenges. Focus on creating a solid, secure, and scalable base that can support the gamification and AI features to come.

Good luck! ðŸš€
