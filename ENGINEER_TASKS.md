# Questlog - Senior Software Engineer Sprint Tasks

## Project Overview
Questlog is a gamified task management application that transforms tasks into quests with AI-powered prioritization, experience points, and motivational design. The goal is to help users overcome executive function challenges through engaging, game-like experiences.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (Web), Electron (Desktop)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Fastify, Python + FastAPI (AI Service)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (cache/sessions)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Custom ML models
- **Infrastructure**: Cloudflare CDN/Gateway, AWS S3, Pinecone (vector DB)

### Task 4: Implement User Registration Endpoint
**Priority**: High
**Story Points**: 3
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

**As a** developer, **I want** a user registration API endpoint **so that** users can create accounts.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Create POST `/auth/register` endpoint
- [ ] Implement password hashing with bcrypt
- [ ] Add email validation and uniqueness check
- [ ] Return JWT token on successful registration
- [ ] Add proper error handling for duplicate emails

**Deliverables**:

### Task 5: Create Basic Quest Table Schema
**Priority**: High
**Story Points**: 2
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

**As a** developer, **I want** a quests table in the database **so that** I can store quest data.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Add quests table to Prisma schema
- [ ] Include core fields (id, title, description, user_id, status, created_at, updated_at)
- [ ] Set up foreign key relationship to users table
- [ ] Generate and run migration

**Deliverables**:

### Task 6: Implement Quest Creation Endpoint
**Priority**: High
**Story Points**: 3
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

**As a** developer, **I want** a quest creation API endpoint **so that** users can create new quests.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Create POST `/quests` endpoint
- [ ] Add JWT authentication middleware
- [ ] Implement quest creation with user association
- [ ] Add input validation for title and description
- [ ] Return created quest with proper status codes

**Deliverables**:
- Quest creation endpoint with authentication
- Input validation and error handling
- User association for quests
- Proper HTTP status codes

**Definition of Done**:
- Authenticated users can create quests

## Notes for the Engineer

1. **Focus on MVP**: These tasks establish the core data and authentication foundation
2. **Security First**: Implement proper authentication and data validation
3. **Documentation**: Update docs/ folder as you build
4. **Testing**: Write basic tests for critical functionality
5. **Agile Approach**: Each task should be completable in one pull request

**Next Sprint Preview**: Once these core tasks are complete, the next sprint will focus on quest listing, updating, and the React frontend for quest management.

Remember: You're building the foundation for a tool that will help people overcome executive function challenges. Focus on creating a solid, secure, and scalable base that can support the gamification and AI features to come.

Good luck! ðŸš€
