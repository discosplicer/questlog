## Notes for the Engineer

1. **Agile Focus**: Each task is designed to be completed in one pull request
2. **User-Centric**: Focus on delivering value to users quickly
3. **Security First**: Implement proper authentication and data validation
4. **Documentation**: Update docs/ folder as you build
5. **Testing**: Write basic tests for critical functionality

**Next Sprint Preview**: Once these core tasks are complete, the next sprint will focus on AI-powered prioritization, gamification features (XP, levels), and advanced quest management.

Remember: You're building the foundation for a tool that will help people overcome executive function challenges. Focus on creating a solid, secure, and scalable base that can support the gamification and AI features to come.

Good luck! ðŸš€
