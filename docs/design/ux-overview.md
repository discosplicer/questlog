- Consistent interaction patterns

### 3. Executive Function Support
- Clear next actions
- Visual task organization
- Progress indicators
- Break complex tasks into manageable steps

### 4. Accessibility
- High contrast options
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Customizable interface elements
