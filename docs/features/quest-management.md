# Quest Management Feature Specification

## Overview

Quest Management is the core feature of Questlog, transforming traditional task management into an engaging, gamified experience. Every task becomes a "quest" with clear objectives, progress tracking, and rewards.

## Core Concepts

### Quest Definition
A quest is a discrete unit of work with:
- **Objective**: Clear description of what needs to be accomplished
- **Progress**: Measurable completion status
- **Rewards**: Experience points and achievements upon completion
- **Context**: Category, project, and metadata

### Quest Types

#### 1. Simple Quests
- Single-step tasks
- Binary completion (done/not done)
- Quick to create and complete
- Examples: "Send email to client", "Buy groceries"

#### 2. Multi-Step Quests
- Complex tasks broken into sub-quests
- Progressive completion tracking
- Dependencies between steps
- Examples: "Plan vacation" → "Research destinations", "Book flights", "Pack bags"

#### 3. Recurring Quests
- Tasks that repeat on a schedule
- Automatic regeneration
- Streak tracking
- Examples: "Daily exercise", "Weekly team meeting"

#### 4. Time-Bound Quests
- Tasks with specific deadlines
- Urgency indicators
- Late penalties
- Examples: "Submit project proposal by Friday", "Pay rent by 1st"
