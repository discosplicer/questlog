# Quest Management

## Overview

Quest Management is the core feature of Questlog, transforming traditional task management into an engaging, gamified experience. The system has been implemented with a production-ready, scalable architecture that supports complex quest workflows and future AI integration.

## ‚úÖ **Implementation Status: COMPLETE**

The quest management system has been fully implemented with enterprise-grade quality, including:

- **Complete database schema** with quests, categories, steps, and tags
- **Full CRUD API** with comprehensive validation and security
- **Production-ready architecture** with proper error handling and monitoring
- **Scalable design** ready for gamification and AI features

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### Database Schema

The quest management system uses a comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with the following entities:

#### Core Entities
- **Quests** - Main quest objects with difficulty, status, priority, and experience points
- **Quest Categories** - Organizational structure for grouping quests
- **Quest Steps** - Breakable sub-tasks within quests
- **Quest Tags** - Flexible tagging system for filtering and organization

#### Key Features
- **UUID primary keys** for security and scalability
- **Proper indexing** on frequently queried fields
- **Cascade deletes** for data integrity
- **Audit trails** with created/updated timestamps
- **Foreign key constraints** with referential integrity

### API Design

The quest service provides a RESTful API with:

- **Comprehensive validation** using Zod schemas
- **Input sanitization** to prevent XSS attacks
- **User authorization** checks on all operations
- **Proper HTTP status codes** and error responses
- **Swagger documentation** for easy integration
- **Rate limiting** and security headers

---

## üéÆ **Quest Features**

### Quest Properties

Each quest includes:

- **Basic Information**: Title, description, difficulty level
- **Status Management**: Draft, Active, In Progress, Completed, Archived
- **Priority System**: Low, Medium, High, Urgent
- **Time Tracking**: Estimated and actual duration
- **Gamification**: Experience points and difficulty-based rewards
- **Organization**: Categories and tags for flexible organization

### Quest Lifecycle

1. **Creation** - Quests start as drafts with basic information
2. **Activation** - Quests can be activated when ready to begin
3. **Progress** - Quests move through various states during completion
4. **Completion** - Finished quests award experience points
5. **Archival** - Completed quests can be archived for reference

### Advanced Features

- **Quest Steps** - Break complex quests into manageable sub-tasks
- **Quest Categories** - Organize quests by project, type, or theme
- **Quest Tags** - Flexible tagging for filtering and search
- **Experience Points** - Gamification rewards based on difficulty and completion

---

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### Validation & Security

```typescript
// Comprehensive validation schemas
const createQuestSchema = z.object({
  title: questTitleSchema,
  description: questDescriptionSchema,
  difficulty: questDifficultySchema,
  estimatedDuration: questDurationSchema,
  priority: questPrioritySchema.optional().default(QuestPriority.MEDIUM),
  categoryId: z.string().uuid().optional(),
  tags: z.array(z.string().max(50)).optional(),
});
```

### Database Operations

```typescript
// Example: Creating a quest with related data
const quest = await prisma.quest.create({
  data: {
    title: sanitizeInput(body.title),
    description: body.description ? sanitizeInput(body.description) : null,
    difficulty: body.difficulty,
    estimatedDuration: body.estimatedDuration,
    priority: body.priority,
    userId: userId,
    categoryId: body.categoryId || null,
    tags: {
      create: body.tags.map(tag => ({
        tagName: sanitizeInput(tag),
      })),
    },
  },
  include: {
    category: true,
    tags: true,
    steps: true,
  },
});
```

#### 2. Multi-Step Quests
- Complex tasks broken into sub-quests
- Progressive completion tracking
- Dependencies between steps
- Examples: "Plan vacation" ‚Üí "Research destinations", "Book flights", "Pack bags"

#### 3. Recurring Quests
- Tasks that repeat on a schedule
