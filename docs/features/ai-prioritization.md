# AI Prioritization Engine Feature Specification

## Overview

The AI Prioritization Engine is Questlog's intelligent brain, inspired by World of Warcraft's RestedXP addon. It analyzes user behavior, quest context, and external factors to suggest the optimal next quest for users to work on, reducing decision fatigue and improving productivity.

## Core Philosophy

### The RestedXP Inspiration
Like RestedXP guides players to the most efficient quest chains, Questlog's AI engine guides users to the most impactful tasks based on:
- **Impact**: Tasks that create the most value
- **Urgency**: Time-sensitive deadlines
- **Energy**: User's current capacity and context
- **Momentum**: Tasks that build on recent progress

### Decision Fatigue Reduction
The engine eliminates the cognitive load of choosing what to do next by:
- Providing clear, actionable recommendations
- Explaining the reasoning behind suggestions
- Adapting to user preferences and patterns
- Learning from user feedback and outcomes

## AI Architecture

### Multi-Model Approach

#### 1. Priority Scoring Model
**Purpose**: Calculate numerical priority scores for quests
**Inputs**:

- Historical patterns (completion rates, time estimates)
- External factors (calendar events, weather, etc.)

**Outputs**:
- Priority score (0-100)
- Confidence level
- Reasoning explanation

#### 2. Context Understanding Model
**Purpose**: Understand user's current situation and constraints
**Inputs**:
- Current time and location
- Calendar events and meetings
- Recent activity patterns
- Device and app usage

**Outputs**:
- Available time window
- Energy level estimate
- Focus capacity

## Priority Algorithm

### Scoring Components

#### 1. Urgency Score (0-40 points)
**Factors**:
- **Deadline proximity**: Days until due date
- **Overdue penalty**: Exponential penalty for late tasks
- **Time sensitivity**: Tasks that lose value over time
- **Dependency impact**: Blocking other important tasks

**Calculation**:
```
Urgency = Base_Urgency * Time_Multiplier * Dependency_Bonus
```

#### 2. Impact Score (0-30 points)
**Factors**:
- **Value creation**: Tasks that create significant value
- **Goal alignment**: Alignment with user's long-term goals
- **Stakeholder impact**: Effect on others
- **Strategic importance**: Long-term strategic value

**Calculation**:
```
Impact = Value_Score * Goal_Alignment * Stakeholder_Impact
```

#### 3. Energy Match Score (0-20 points)
**Factors**:
- **Task complexity**: Simple vs. complex tasks
- **User energy level**: Current mental/physical capacity
- **Time available**: Duration of available work window
- **Context fit**: Suitability for current environment

**Calculation**:
```
Energy_Match = Complexity_Fit * Energy_Level * Time_Fit * Context_Fit
```

#### 4. Momentum Score (0-10 points)
**Factors**:
- **Recent progress**: Building on recent achievements
- **Streak maintenance**: Continuing productive streaks
- **Category focus**: Deep work in specific areas
- **Flow state**: Maintaining productive flow

**Calculation**:
```
Momentum = Progress_Bonus * Streak_Bonus * Focus_Bonus * Flow_Bonus
```

### Dynamic Weighting

#### Adaptive Weights
The algorithm adjusts component weights based on:
- **User feedback**: Explicit preferences and overrides
